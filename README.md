# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I had with my project was creating the pseudocode I had re wrote it alot.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The way I over came this problem was by looking at the coding I did and just read it like
I was reading it to someone who didnt know how to program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The way I overcame the roadblocks ahead of me is by looking for more reasours online and getting feedback from
my instructor. The craziest assisgnment I had to deal with was the hash tables. I've uploaded that assisgnment 
5 times. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This work gave me a better approach by allowing me to focus more and grasp the smallest details that 
are needed when developing programs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project really gave me a deeper understanding on everything. It gave me a different 
view of looking how everything works.
